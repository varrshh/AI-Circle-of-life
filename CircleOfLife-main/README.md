CS 520 - Project2 

The purpose of this project is to build a probabilistic model of an environment in the presence of uncertainty, 
anduse it to inform and direct decision making.  You are pursuing a prey object, while simultaneously being pursuedby a predator object, and want to 
capture your target and evade capture yourself.  This will be complicated by notnecessarily being able to see where the predator and prey are - but you 
must use the information you have to makethe most informed decisions you can about what to do.

How to run: 
  1. python3 <agent_.py>
  2. enable DEBUG = True (for the graph display) and more information reveal 
 
Returns based on Goal: 
  1. Failure, if Predator catches the Prey 
  2. Success, if Agent catches the prey avoiding predator
  
Internally... 
the eg: Agent1.py will import CreateEnvironment, PreyPredator and NetworkX classes and starts to play out
